# Change 1: Abstraction of the Dataframe Class

We applied the prinicple of abstraction in our code when creating the class Dataframe, with subclasses for dataframes of workouts or of goals. At first, we only created a specific class for the dataframe of workouts. But when working on the functionality of setting goals, we noticed that the structures required to save them and a lot of the functionalities, like saving the dataframe, editing or deleting entries, are very similar what we implemented for the dataframe of workouts. Only details differ between the two classes, like the column names the dataframe needs and what information is passed to create a new entry. So, we restructured our code for the Dataframe class to be more generic and added the more detailed functions to the subclasses.

# Change 2: Decomposition of the main program

We used some decomposition on a coarse level when designing the main program. The components are all the main functionalities our program should have, like logging a new workout, setting a goal or showing the progress, and each of them was put into their own function. The functions are wrapped together in the main program to create the full logic for the user experience.
