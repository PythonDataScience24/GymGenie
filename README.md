Notes for Dario: can you check that our names will be a link to out profiles?
Just change anything you want to about the phrasing. 
Maybe we should have somehting more specific about how to download and test our application, but i don't know how they will download it etc.
We need to add some key resources, but I didn't know what they would be, so I didn't add any yet.
