What we are doing: We are developing an application for tracking yoour workouts
For whom are we doing it? To simplify the process your progress and be consitante in the workouts schedule.
What makes it special? We have nice visualization. Visualization makes it easier to track the progress
How to get started? Proof read the code, suggest new visualization features
Where to find the key resource? Links to docs, ect


# Project Roadmap

- Project summary and welcome: Project summary from README
                             welocome: Who are we, description
- How to get involved? Feel free to send us ideas (insert email)



## Timeline:

### Milestone 1: Exercise Logging
Allow users to input data about their workouts, including the type of exercise, duration, distance (if applicable), and calories burned. Store this data in a dataframe.
- **Deadline**: 02.05.2024

### Milestone 2: Goal Setting and Progress Tracking
Enable users to set personal fitness goals, such as weekly exercise duration, distance, or calories burned. Retrieve and display their progress toward these goals based on their logged workouts.
- **Deadline**: 16.05.2024

### Milestone 3: Data Visualization and Trends
Provide users with visualizations of their exercise data, such as weekly/monthly summaries, progress charts, or comparisons of different exercise types. Allow users to analyze trends in their workout habits over time.
- **Deadline**: 23.05.2024

## Tasks to be done for each milestone:

### Milestone 1:

- Create the parent class `Workout` with the properties: date, duration, calories, distance, and dataframe
- Create the child class `Exercise` with a list of options for the user: running, cycling, strength, swimming, hiking/walking, skiing, others
- Include subclasses for each property:
    - `Date`: Date of the workout
    - `Duration`: Duration of the workout in minutes
    - `Calories`: Calories burned during the workout
    - `Distance`: Distance covered during the workout (if applicable)
    - `Dataframe`: Pandas dataframe to store workout data. 
                  It is written in a csv file. When the user close the session the data is saved and then when it re-opens, we can read and re-use it.
    - `Impression`: Rating of the workout on a scale of 1 to 10
- **Contributors**: Laura, Kristin
- Create `main.py` to run the main program 
- Implement user interaction for inputting workout data sequentially
  - Show summary and allow user for modification or saving at the end
- - **Contributors**: Lea, Dario
- Open for future or to other contributors: suggest calories in-take


### Milestone 2:
- Create `Goals` class for setting and managing fitness goals
  - Allow setting goals for duration, distance, or calories burned 
  - Provide tips for SMART goals
  - Specify the timeframe (week/moth/year)
- Implement `Progress` class for tracking progress toward goals
  - Plot progress( in terms of duration/calories/distance) over time 
  - Provide feedback (a goal is reached / "keep going" / not reached yet) on goal achievement
- **Contributors**: Laura, Kristin, Lea, Dario

### Milestone 3:
- Develop `Summary` class to generate summaries and visualizations of exercise data
  - Merge different types of exercises (e.g. running and cycling), show weekly and monthly trends
  - Show specific behaviour in the exercises
  - Perform linear regression of general exercise and specific sports
  - Comparison of different exercises
- **Contributors**: Laura, Kristin, Lea, Dario

## Relevant timeframes:
28.04.2024 - Prepare GUI
20.04.2024 - Meeting before Biostatistics lecture
